# Cyber-Intel
This is the documentation of the project done in the Introduction to Cyber Intelligence Course wherein a team was asked to pick a Fortune 500 company and perform threat analysis on it based solely on publicly available information on the company and its employees. The team then outlined hypothetical attack scenarios and gave safety recommendations.

## Part 1
In this section of the project we performed initial reconnaissance and learnt about: 
* Company Structure and C-Suite
* Middle and Lower-level employees
* Technologies used in the company and their vulnerabilities
* Points of initial contact with employees

## Part 2
In this section of the project we performed threat modeling in the following ways:
* Came up with a list of the company's critical assets
* Built threat actor profiles using concepts like Persona non Grata, Security Cards, and STRIDE
* Built attack trees for threat actors
* Wrote guidelines for employees on how to protect themselves from cyber attacks

## Part 3
In this seciton of the project we recommended setting up a fusion center with the following specifications: 
* Outlined the Intelligence Requirements (IRs) and Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs)
* Created Threat Analysis and Strategic Analysis Workflows
* Defined the fusion center job roles
* Recommended tools to have in the fusion center
* Outlined the monitoring activity and IOCs to track
* Created a plan for response to insider threat
* Created a hierarchical reporting structure
